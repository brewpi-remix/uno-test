# BrewPi Family Arduino Uno Test

This firmware will allow you to test the setup of your BrewPi family Arduino Uno.  The program will:

1. Turn the onboard LED on
1. Scan for an I2C device.  If found, it will use A0 for sensor tests; otherwise, it will use the original A4 pin for sensors.  If the program detects an I2C LCD, a test message will display
1. Check the OneWire
    1. Display if parasitic sensors are present on the bus
    1. Display the number and type of sensors found
    1. Display the address and current temperature for each sensor
1. Test the heat and cool relays (pins 5 and 6)
1. Clear the EEPROM to avoid issues saving the sensors later on

It will automatically check for an I2C display, and if found, will show a test on the display.  It will then scan the proper pin for the variant; A4 if no I2C is detected, and A0 if an I2C is present.

Results using a standard or parallel LCD system:

# Flashing from Internet

Provided you Pi has `avrdude` installed (which is installed as part of BrewPi,) you may issue a few commands to download and flash the test firmware.

## Find Port

You will need the path to the serial port used by the Arduino Uno.  Assuming you have BrewPi installed, you may leverage some of the installed libraries to find the path to that port:

1. Change to the BrewPi user: `sudo su - brewpi`
2. Activate the virtual environment: `activate`
3. List compatible serial ports (command is all one line): `python -c 'from autoSerial import find_compatible_serial_ports as fp; print(list(fp()))'`

Example:

``` bash
(bpr) brewpi@brewpi:~ $ python -c 'from autoSerial import find_compatible_serial_ports as fp; print(list(fp()))'
[('/dev/ttyUSB0', 'Arduino Uno')]
```

In this case, /dev/ttyUSB0 is the only Arduino Uno found.  If there is more than one, a list will be printed.  Pick the `/dev/*` device you wish to manipulate.

If oyu do not have BrewPi installed, you will habe to find the port in a different way.

## BrewPi Wiring Test

Download the wiring test firmware to your home directory:

``` bash
curl -O https://github.com/brewpi-remix/uno-test/raw/main/firmware/firmware.hex -o "/home/pi/firmware.hex"
```

Flash the test firmware (remember to change the serial port in the -P argument below):

``` bash
/usr/share/arduino/hardware/tools/avrdude -F -e -p atmega328p -c arduino -b 115200 -P /dev/ttyUSB0 -U flash:w:"/home/pi/firmware.hex" -C "/usr/share/arduino/hardware/tools/avrdude.conf"
```

## Blank Uno

To blank the Uno, download the blank firmware to your home directory:

``` bash
curl -O https://github.com/brewpi-remix/uno-test/raw/main/firmware/blank.hex -o "/home/pi/blank.hex"
```

Flash the blank firmware (remember to change the serial port in the -P argument below):

``` bash
/usr/share/arduino/hardware/tools/avrdude -F -e -p atmega328p -c arduino -b 115200 -P /dev/ttyUSB0 -U flash:w:"/home/pi/blank.hex" -C "/usr/share/arduino/hardware/tools/avrdude.conf"
```
